# ChIP-Seq

This workflow demonstrates ChIP-Seq analysis in *Escherichia coli* by performing peak detection in a treatment sample using MACS. It is a Cuneiform transcription of a [hands-on introduction to ChIP-Seq](http://www.biologie.ens.fr/~mthomas/other/chip-seq-training/) by Morgane Thomas-Chollier which itself is based on a study by [Myers et al. 2013](http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1003565).

A detailed description can be found on the [Cuneiform website](http://cuneiform-lang.org/examples/2016/04/29/chip-seq/). This cookbook installs all necessary tools, downloads all necessary data, sets up Cuneiform, and places the [workflow](https://github.com/joergen7/chip-seq/blob/master/templates/default/chip-seq.cf.erb) in a predetermined location. The cookbook can be run on any system in a virtual machine. For running the cookbook natively, an Ubuntu 16.04 or higher is required.

Below you find installation instructions for, both, the native and the virtual machine setup.
